PROJECT TITLE: AI-Driven Supply Chain Disruption Predictor and Inventory Optimization System

Project Overview: This project aims to revolutionize supply chain management through the development of an advanced AI-powered system.
The solution monitors global supply chain data, predicts potential disruptions, and optimizes inventory levels dynamically. 
It integrates natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and ERP systems, providing businesses with real-time insights, risk management tools, 
and inventory recommendations to maintain operational continuity

Milestone 3:
Weeks 5-6 Predictive models will be developed utilizing historical data and insights from the data analysis engine. These models will forecast 
the likelihood and impact of supply chain disruptions (e.g., natural disasters, political instability, transportation delays), predict changes in consumer
demand (e.g., seasonality, economic trends), and forecast future inventory levels. Machine learning algorithms, such as time series forecasting and regression
models, will be explored for model development. Secure and reliable integration will be established with the organization's ERP system (e.g., SAP) 
through the development of APIs or other suitable mechanisms. This integration will enable seamless data exchange between the AI system and the ERP, 
facilitating automated inventory adjustments based on the predictive models (e.g., adjusting order quantities, re-routing shipments).
